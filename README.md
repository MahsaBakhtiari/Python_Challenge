# Python Challenge

Two-part of the project uses Python to analyze a company's financial records, and part two automates a town's vote-counting process.


## PyBank and PyPoll

The ***PyBank*** module takes financial records of a company and returns, the number of months covered in the data, total profit/loss in that period, the average of changes in that period, and the month and date of the most significant decrease and increase.

The ***PyPoll*** module automizes the vote counting system of a town. It returns the election's winner and an analysis of the election that contains: total votes, a list of the candidates and their total votes, and the percentage of votes they won.
